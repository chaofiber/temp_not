I was born in Zhejiang, China and finished my high school there. I obtained my undergraduate degree in *Theoretical and Applied Mechanics* and *Economics* at Peking University. After that, I went to Switzerland and continued my studies as a master student in *Robotics, Systems and Control* at ETH Zurich.

I am interested in the research area bridging learning and control, and especially its application to the real robots. I am planning to continue my PhD in this direction.

In my free time, I enjoy taking pictures, cycling and traveling. I am also keen to body building.
